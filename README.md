# Build The Kajaani Castle

Unity project that we finished in 12 hour game jam.

# Short description:
Build as high tower as possible while being shot by cannons!
Don't let your tower fall or you will lose.
You gain more score by building a higher tower.

You can click and drag bricks in order to build a higher tower.
Use your right mouse button to rotate the brick to a vertical
or horizontal rotation.
